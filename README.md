## User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

## Usage Instructions
1. Open the document on your local device at the beginning of your day - you'll enter scheduled events/reminders into the planner to keep tracked.
2. Scroll down to see the timeblocks for the current day.
3. Click on the timeblocks type to edit the events.
4. Click the save button (on the right) to save the event.
5. Refresh the page to see the changes.
6. Events not saved in timeblocks before refresh won't be tracked locally.
